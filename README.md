#### Trie
This folder contains problems related to Trie.
###### 208. Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)
Implement a trie data structure, including insert, searchWord and isPrefix. Note that at for each word, we want to make
the node leaf (isLeaf = true) at insertion. Then we can distinguish word from prefix in this way. We assume that the word is a prefix of itself.

###### 211. Add and Search Word - Data structure design
This is based on problem 208. First implement a Trie, and then do a backtracking if word has "." (regular expression).
If the word has no regular expression (.), then do a typical Trie search.

#### Backtracking
This folder contains problems that need to use backtracking to solve.

#### Data Structure
This folder contains problems related to other data structures, such as Deque (Queue, Stack).

## Hard
This folder contains all the problems that are classified as hard on Leetcode.
